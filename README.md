## LaTeX College Notes

### Overview
Personal repository for my college lecture notes written in LaTeX. Each course lives in its own directory, with subfolders for chapters, tutorials, or compiled artifacts.

### Repository Structure
```
LatexNotes/
  CS-105/
    DiscreteStructures/
      Discrete_Structures.tex      # main TeX source
      Discrete_Structures.pdf      # compiled PDF (git-tracked here)
      Discrete_Structures.*        # aux files generated by LaTeX
  MA-105/
    ChapterNotes/
    TutorialSolutions/
```

### How to Build
- Recommended: `latexmk` (auto-runs the required engines and multiple passes).
- Alternates: `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, or `lualatex` (may require multiple runs + bib tool).

Build a specific set of notes, for example Discrete Structures:
```bash
latexmk -pdf CS-105/DiscreteStructures/Discrete_Structures.tex
```

Clean auxiliary files for that document:
```bash
latexmk -c CS-105/DiscreteStructures/Discrete_Structures.tex
```

Full clean (including generated PDF):
```bash
latexmk -C CS-105/DiscreteStructures/Discrete_Structures.tex
```

### Dependencies
- TeX distribution: TeX Live (recommended) or MiKTeX
- Tools: `latexmk`

On Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed texlive-most latexmk biber
```

If a document uses fonts or packages from optional collections, install the corresponding TeX Live packages.

### Editor Setup (Optional)
- VS Code: Install “LaTeX Workshop” extension for build-on-save, PDF preview, and linting.
- Any editor is fine; ensure your PATH includes the LaTeX binaries (e.g., `pdflatex`, `latexmk`).

### Conventions
- Course directories named by course code (e.g., `CS-105`, `MA-105`).
- Keep one primary `*.tex` per compiled document; auxiliary outputs are allowed to live alongside for convenience.
- Prefer vector images (PDF/SVG -> converted to PDF for inclusion) under a course-specific images folder if needed.
