## LaTeX College Notes

### Overview
Public repository for my college lecture notes written in LaTeX. Each course lives in its own directory, with subfolders for chapters, tutorials, or compiled artifacts.

### Editor Setup (Optional)
- VS Code: Install “LaTeX Workshop” extension for build-on-save, PDF preview, and linting.
- Any editor is fine; ensure your PATH includes the LaTeX binaries (e.g., `pdflatex`, `latexmk`).

### Conventions
- Course directories named by course code (e.g., `CS-105`, `MA-105`).
- Keep one primary `*.tex` per compiled document.
- Prefer vector images (PDF/SVG -> converted to PDF for inclusion) under a course-specific images folder if needed.

### Contributing
Suggestions and corrections are welcome via issues or small pull requests.
